# Tumor Growth Localization and Classification using U-Net
Project overview
This project aims to use the U-Net architecture for localizing tumor growth in medical images, specifically in cases where tumor boundaries are not easily discernible to the human eye. The U-Net model will be trained to generate masks highlighting the tumor area. Subsequently, the generated masks will be classified to determine whether the tumor is malignant, benign, or normal.

Introduction
Tumor localization and classification are crucial tasks in medical image analysis. This project utilizes the U-Net architecture, a popular deep learning model for semantic segmentation tasks, to pinpoint the tumor regions in medical images. Once the localization is achieved, the generated mask images will be classified to determine the tumor's nature: malignant, benign, or normal.

About Dataset
The data reviews the medical images of breast cancer using ultrasound scan.Breast Ultrasound Dataset is categorized into three classes: normal, benign, and malignant images. Breast ultrasound images can produce great results in classification, detection, and segmentation of breast cancer when combined with machine learning.

The data collected at baseline include breast ultrasound images among women in ages between 25 and 75 years old. This data was collected in 2018. The number of patients is 600 female patients. The dataset consists of 780 images with an average image size of 500*500 pixels. The images are in PNG format. The ground truth images are presented with original images. The images are categorized into three classes, which are normal, benign, and malignant.
